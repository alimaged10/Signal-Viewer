## Introduction

The Multi-Channel Signal Viewer is a user-friendly desktop application that allows users to upload, visualize, and manipulate multiple signal channels. With dynamic phase signal loading, users can adjust signal attributes, control individual signals, rewind, export data statistics, and link two channels for synchronized actions.

## Features

### Uploading Signals

1. **Upload Multiple Signals Per Channel:** You can upload more than one signal per channel. To do this, navigate to the menu bar, choose "File," then select "Add Signal." Choose the channel you want to plot in. (Note: All signals are uploaded in dynamic phase.)

4. **Rewind Signals:** To reset the signals to their initial state, press the "Rewind" button.

### Exporting Data and Snapshots

5. **Export Data Statistics and Snapshots:** You can export data statistics of the plotted graphs along with snapshots of the channels. Exporting can be done for Channel 1, Channel 2, or both channels. To export data, follow these steps:
   - From the menu bar, choose "Export."
   - Select "Channel 1," "Channel 2," or "Both Channels." (Note: If you attempt to export an empty channel, an error message will appear.)

### Linking Channels

6. **Linking Channels:** Linking the two channels allows actions applied to the first channel to be automatically mirrored in the second channel. This includes actions like zooming in/out, speeding up/down, pausing/playing, and rewinding.
